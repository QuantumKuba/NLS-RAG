This suggests the letter to his sister was sent on **21 April 1802** while on the ship at sea.\n\n    Additionally, the third passage mentions **Henry Arbuthnot** writing letters from the ship to his father, mother, and sister **Ann**, but does not specify a date for the letter to his sister.

However, the passage from Colonel Ross's letter mentions that Lord Cornwallis has not yet heard a syllable from the India House or any other quarter concerning Colonel Duff's business, but that he will continue his sanction and is anxious for Colonel Duff to remain in his present station. This implies that Lord Cornwallis has not yet written to Dundas about the Army in India. However, the passage from the letter from Colonel Benigal to Mr. Dundas, dated 7 November 1794, mentions that Colonel Benigal has been requested by Lord Dundas to give his opinion on the best mode of new modelling the Army in India, and that he has endeavoured to divest his mind of every kind of partiality and prejudice in stating the principles and regulations of this plan. This implies that Lord Dundas requested Colonel Benigal's opinion, but it does not explicitly state that Lord Cornwallis dispatched a letter to Lord Dundas regarding the best mode of new modelling the Army in India. However, the passage from the letter from Colonel Benigal to Mr. Dundas, dated 7 November 1794, is a response to a request from Lord Dundas, and it is likely that Lord Cornwallis would have been involved in this process.
